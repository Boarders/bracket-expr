## Bracket Expr

This program takes an unbracketed expression using arithmetic operators `+, -, *, /` 
and parses all possible bracketings and their values. It can give this output
in the form of ascii trees but also as SVG using `diagrams`.

## Example
The input "5 * 8 - 6 / 2" gives the following image with diagrams:

The `ascii` output looks as follows:
